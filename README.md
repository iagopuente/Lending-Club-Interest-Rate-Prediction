# Lending Club Interest Rate Prediction

## Overview

This project explores predictive modeling techniques to forecast interest rates for loan applications on the Lending Club platform. Using historical loan data, the project aims to identify key variables influencing interest rates and build robust predictive models to aid decision-making processes for lenders and borrowers.

## Objectives

- Analyze historical Lending Club data to understand patterns and variables affecting interest rates.
- Develop predictive models using statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance to determine the most effective method for predicting interest rates.

## Data Description

The data set utilized includes various financial and personal attributes of loan applicants from Lending Club, such as:

- Loan amount
- Applicant income
- Credit score
- Loan purpose
- Term of loan
- Debt-to-income ratio

The data has been processed to handle missing values, outliers, and to perform feature engineering to enhance predictive accuracy.

## Methodology

The following steps outline the methodological approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Cleaning and imputing missing data
   - Outlier detection and removal
   - Feature engineering and selection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Visualization of data distributions and relationships
   - Correlation analysis among variables

3. **Model Development**

   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R-squared

## Results

Model performance metrics will be provided, highlighting the best-performing predictive model based on the accuracy and generalization ability across test sets.
